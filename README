Usage:
To run and compile: python3 main.py

- First enter a valid battery amount
- Robot will then ask for a command (must be either spot, general, or done)
- if done is requested robot program ends
- if spot or general are requested, program completes the full cleaning task
and awaits another command
- if battery drops below 30 during a cleaning task, the robot will dock and
recharge first, then continue where it left off from its cleaning task 

Battery and charging: when robot docks, battery is automatically set to 100
meaning there are no charging cycles

Dusty spot sensor: Dusty spot sensor has a 1/3 chance of detecting a dirty spot.
To change this probability, edit parameters on line 47 of main.py

Clean Floor Task: This task has a 1/10 chance of failure (failure results in 
completion of the CleanFloor task). To change this probability, edit parameters
on line 6 of clean_floor.py
